title: "Code As Craft As Career?"

  As a career programmer, I pursue code mastery. Economics at scale however
  stamps out the craftsman. How do I stay ahead?
---

I see 2 paths of career programmers around me: 1) transition to leadership, 2)
keep coding, master its craft. Respect to people who follow either, if that’s
what you like. I lean toward the 2nd path because I like creating. Really
though, I want a 3rd path, something fundamentally more productive than coding.

It is still an enormous, almost-but-not-quite rote, still error-prone task of
spinning up a quick idea. It takes years of practice to robustly instruct the
computer in even a trivial task, [in the robotic equivalent of making a
sandwich][Imperative thinking and the making of
sandwiches].

So I study up on the latest languages. Or frameworks. Or someone mentions
inversion of control. Or to be judicious with regular expressions. "Yes. Cool.
I appreciate that tip. I’ll add that to my toolbox.” And back to coding. Better
than before. But largely business as usual.

Am I the only one looking for something more?

Meanwhile code craftsmanship may be polishing the brass on the Titanic. I don’t
mean career programmers will drown right away. You will have your place for the
foreseeable future, as long as you put some effort into ongoing learning. But
if history is any indication, technology _accelerates_ forward. It does not
move at a constant rate. There may be less time for you than you think.

We see whole creative industries marginalized or eliminated by production at
scale.

Never heard of a typesetter? [The End of Coding as We Know It] explains.

As a web programmer, you scoff at the notion of Adobe Dreamweaver or
Squarespace. "Those can’t do what I can do by hand! Notepad.exe for life!” And
maybe those WYSIWYG editors never will match your handmade code.

However this response is similar to the scoffs of the above woodworker and
typesetter, now marginalized. They learned the hard way that people don’t want
everything ornately handmade. You can sob all you want about how the times are
changing, that nobody wants craft anymore. Most consumers though will settle
for cheap and highly available. Economics wins.

How long until hand-coded websites go this way? Databases? Cloud
infrastructure?

Don’t limit this to just the web. Think how this might apply to your insistence
on _text_ being the be-all-end-all of programming.

(Or, a little further out, [humans programming at all][Humans Need Not Apply].)

So I’ve leaned on code as craft for a while. I don’t like to ship buggy code. I
don’t like it when my past code architecture comes back to bite me. I’m pleased
when it reads and operates elegantly, whether a customer ever appreciates that
or not. I’m pleased when this lets me predict requests and outmaneuver
competitors. These are not things you acquire from a book. They require
practice. Yet it's all incremental.

I appreciate the boosts, but I’ve never met a coding technique or tool that
gave me a 100x programming productivity boost. This discourages me from code as
craft as an ultimate career option.

"Programming is hard," you say. "How can you expect a 100x boost?"

Because humans created coding. We created it for a boost. If we look beyond the
faster-horse mentality with our current programming methods, we can create a
better way.

Admittedly, I'm not prescribing how here. I'm just pitching the idea there's
something better.

Call me an [expert beginner][How Developers Stop Learning: Rise of the Expert
Beginner]. Maybe I hit a local maximum with techniques like OOP, FP, TDD. I
certainly didn’t master them. I appreciate their takeaways. But I don’t see
them putting me miles ahead if I continue to study them for 10 years. If I'm
wrong, if I gave up too easily, please reach out with a, “Trust me, you’ll
never look back if you stick with X.”

Side note regarding the holy wars between these competing techniques. Think the
above OOP, FP, TDD, or Emacs vs. Vim, spaces vs. tabs, Python vs. Ruby. The
fact our industry hasn’t unanimously adopted one side or the other and moved on
indicates that neither is sufficient. Fighting for the side you happen to be on
is not worth the stress. The technology that ultimately matters is not some
hotly debated contender. What matters is the technology where _you forget what
the old way of doing things even was_.

Did you know there was a typesetter profession?

This is why [I try not to be bogged down by the Hacker News firehose of new
coding tech][Ongoing Learning in Breadth & Depth]. My practice of specific tools
in the present won't be a total waste in a few years when a new set of tools
becomes trendy. You might say this is because fundamentally programming doesn't
change. More direly, it's because _how people program_ hasn't changed.

I want a change! How programming is done is stale. I want to create faster,
more richly. I don’t think text coding can offer that, in the long run.

So tell me, is there a 3rd career path? Or are my only choices 1) give up
direct creation and move into leadership, or 2) polish my text?
