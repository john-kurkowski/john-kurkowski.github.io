import Experience from '../components/resume/experience.astro'

I’m a full stack web developer, frontend-leaning. I’m obsessed with UX, DX, and
raising team capability. With 14+ years in the game, I specialize in the
following.

- **Incremental, continuous delivery.** Don’t see progress for weeks? Doesn’t
  turn out how you imagined? I spot bottlenecks to help you [connect faster to
  what you’re creating][Inventing On Principle]. Your team will love [the
  momentum from showing][Showing Code Every Day Or Two], not telling.

- **Stuck with a UX mess?** Didn’t bake in UX from the start? That’s okay. [It
  happens to everyone.][Corporate UX Maturity: Stages 1-4]

  - Improve incrementally, **without rewriting** from scratch. Delivering
    frequently actually **reduces risk**. Rewriting is a risky shock to your
    codebase and customers. Nobody wants to get shocked.

  - Use **design systems** to rethink your designer-developer handoff. No
    designer? Stay lean with open frameworks.

- **Stuck with legacy, buggy, or unfinished code?** I have a knack for
  debugging. I love to strategize how to evolve a system from current point A to
  desired point B. Then change the plane’s engines during flight.

- **Automated tests.** Haven’t been testing your frontend? Certain changes
  collapse the house of cards? I’ve worked on teams with 0% test coverage and
  100% test coverage. I teach the happy medium.

- **Web tech stack.** You wanted buzzword bingo, you got it. I excel at
  TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, Python, JVM, CI/CD,
  [OSS](https://github.com/pulls?q=author%3Ajohn-kurkowski+is%3Apublic+-user%3Ajohn-kurkowski),
  and
  [develop in public](https://github.com/pulls?q=author%3Ajohn-kurkowski+is%3Apublic+user%3Ajohn-kurkowski+).

- **Overcommunication.** I’ve been on both sides of the consultant vs. hiring
  in-house debate. If I’m unable to integrate well, _I’ll be the squeaky wheel_.
  I want our collaboration to be efficient and a good experience for all.
