## About Me

I'm a software consultant who helps with the **development** of the **user
experience (UX)**. With 10+ years in the game, I help you modernize your
**existing** frontend stack to ship **incrementally**.

I specialize in the following.

* **Incremental, continuous delivery.** Don't see progress for weeks?
  Doesn't turn out how you imagined? I spot bottlenecks to help you [connect
  faster to what you're creating][Inventing On Principle]. Your team will love
  the momentum from [showing][Showing Code Every Day Or Two], not telling.

* **Stuck with a user experience mess?** Didn't bake in UX from the start?
  That's okay. [It happens to everyone.][Corporate UX Maturity: Stages 1-4]

    * Improve incrementally, **without rewriting** from scratch. Delivering
      frequently actually **reduces risk**. Rewriting is a risky shock to your
      codebase and customers. Nobody wants to get shocked.

    * I'm a fresh pair of eyes to catch your initial usability issues. But
      neither of us are your customer. I'll teach how to continually test.

* **Stuck with legacy code?** I have a knack for debugging. I love
  to strategize how to evolve a system from current point A to desired point B,
  how to change the plane's engines in flight.

* **Automated tests.** Haven't been testing your frontend? Certain changes
  collapse the house of cards? I've worked on teams with 0% test coverage and
  100% test coverage. I'll teach the happy medium.

* **Team augmentation.** I can spike the above processes with you. Or handle
  overflow tasks. I've worked remotely, asynchronously, and independently for
  years.

* **Overcommunication.** I've been on both sides of the consultant vs. hiring
  in-house debate. If I'm unable to integrate well, I'll be the squeaky wheel.
  I want our collaboration to be efficient and a good experience for all.
