## About Me

I'm a software consultant who helps with the **development** of the **user
experience (UX)**. I help you modernize your **existing** frontend stack to
ship **incrementally**. You don't need to rewrite from scratch. This reduces
risk for you and customers.

Didn't see progress from your developer for weeks? I like to [show progress
frequently][Showing Code Every Day Or Two]. I can show you how too. Your team
will love the momentum from showing, not telling.

Didn't bake in user experience from the start? Stuck with a mess? That's okay.
[It happens to everyone.][Corporate UX Maturity: Stages 1-4] While it's not
something you bolt on after the fact, I help you evolve UX as a core part of
your product and team.

That's why I specialize in existing, legacy systems. I have a knack to debug
any such system. Like a solutions architect, I figure out how to get the
frontend from current point A to desired point B. All while maintaining a
delightfully smooth user experience.

I can augment a team and spike the above processes for you. Or I can handle
overflow tasks. I've worked remotely, asynchronously, and independently for
years.

### Consultant vs. In-House

I understand both sides of the consultant vs. hiring in-house debate. I used to
look down on consultants we worked with. Why didn't they "just get it?"

Then I learned, rather than shaming (just like bad UX), you have to look at the
constraints that lead to the problem. In-house, we had a tight team that met
regularly to discuss in-flight work and code quality. Consultants weren't on
the invite. Even when we captured decisions in code, consultants had restricted
code permissions. How were they supposed to be on the same page as us? We made
them 2nd class citizens in our organization.

As a consultant, if I'm unable to integrate well, I will be the squeaky wheel.
I will let you know. I want to be augment effectively. I want our collaboration
to be a good experience. That's why I show progress frequently and err on the
side of overcommunication.

### UX Focus

It's my personal mission to make human-computer interfaces more usable and
informative. There's a tendency to disregard the user or think you need flashy,
unique interaction, when [all the user wants is predictable behavior and to
learn][Avoid Interaction & Modes].

I grew up in the Internet age, thrilled by what a computer could do for me. A
familiar story for most techies.

However I'm *scarred* from being unable to share that thrill. In contrast to
me, for all my family and peers, computers did nothing but get in their way.
[Computers are too difficult, and it's no wonder most people remain
illiterate][Computers are too difficult].

The design of everyday things is often irresponsible and insulting. The
software industry can do better. Wherever I'm involved as a software engineer,
I aim to bring sensitivity to this.
