    <p class='mt-8 text-xl'>
      I‚Äôm a full stack web developer, frontend-leaning. I‚Äôm obsessed with UX,
      DX, and raising team capability. With 14+ years in the game, I specialize
      in the following.
    </p>

    <ol class='mt-8 text-xl'>
      <li class='flex'>
        <span aria-label='Ship' role='img'> üö¢ </span>
        <span class='ml-4'>
          <em>Ship</em> incrementally, with test coverage confidence, without rewrites.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li class='mt-2 flex'>
        <span aria-label='Wrench' role='img'> üîß </span>
        <span class='ml-4'>
          <em>Debug</em> any app (or process), existing or legacy.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li class='mt-2 flex'>
        <span aria-label='Test tube' role='img'> ü§ù </span>

        Evolve your frontend to ship incrementally. You don‚Äôt need to rewrite
        from scratch. Reduce risk for you and customers. Your team will love the
        momentum from showing, not telling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just want a tune up? I debug any existing, legacy, or unfinished system.
        I tend to work in TypeScript and Python, and I love learning new tech.
