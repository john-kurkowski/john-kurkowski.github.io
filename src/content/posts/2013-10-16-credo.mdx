Here’s a collection of the high-level concepts I’ve adopted over the years. I
think they add human value—to customers and teammates alike—and GTD value. All
while keeping me happy with my career in the otherwise often bitter IT
ecosystem.

### Engineering

- “First make it possible. Then make it beautiful. Then make it fast.”
  [Suffering-oriented programming](http://nathanmarz.com/blog/suffering-oriented-programming.html).

- “Functionality is an asset, code is a liability.” Additional code is the
  enemy. Do whatever I can to be lazy and code less.

- Stop myself from charging into a discussion or problem. Instead step back and
  admit, “I don’t know what I’m doing.” It’s the first step toward a better
  solution.

- Ongoing learning.

  - For better or worse, programming is about learning and doing something new
    everyday. It’s a tricky, imperfect balance to improve at my job with breadth
    and depth. With that in mind:

    - Breadth: don’t judge books by their covers. Yet accept you can’t learn
      everything.
    - Depth:
      [don’t be zealous about the technologies you do study deeply](http://prog21.dadgum.com/128.html).
      You sound like a dick, and blind yourself to complementary tech and better
      solutions.

- Defining but not bulletproof themes

  - Make illegal states unrepresentable

    - i.e. an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Why publish
      interfaces (for consumers or devs) that let users get into trouble,
      especially after it’s too late (e.g. “runtime”)?

    - In programming, this is commonly associated with advanced static type
      systems. Meanwhile, less expressive or dynamic type systems make this a
      pain to enforce. For example, languages where any reference can be
      [`null`](https://twitter.com/franklinchen/status/271325240137756672).

    - Yet there are no bug-free applications. Q: What do all bugs have in
      common? A:
      [They got past your type checker and your tests](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy).
      In light of this, when the cost to implement prevention is high, is it
      wiser to focus on easing production issue diagnosis? Using simpler,
      composable functionality?

  - Tools that let you focus on what makes your app special

    - For example, every webapp these days needs user accounts, a login page, a
      change password page, pagination, etc. Frameworks like
      [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and
      [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) provide all this functionality
      for you. Rolling these features for yourself _is over_. Do _you_, homie.

    - Not to say monolithic frameworks like these don’t come with a developer
      cost. You want to customize one of these components to be _slightly_
      different? Gonna have a bad time.

- [Twitter](http://twitter.com) to keep on top of things.

  - Twitter’s just an example; use any mix of interest-based discovery with some
    social filtration, so you don’t have to troll myriad RSS feeds. Let relevant
    content come to you.

  - Follow posters who seem to know what they’re talking about yet _don’t
    coincide with your point of view_. This is the best way I’ve found to engage
    with topics you’ve never heard, or thought were laughable before. It says
    something there are people smarter than you strongly clinging to these
    foreign ideas.

  - Trim the subscriptions down to just the ones that enrich your knowledge and
    life, without overwhelming you. No hurt feelings in cutting off
    subscriptions. It’s an interest network, not a friend network.

- Avoid online arguments; they tend to make you bitter

  - I can’t say categorically avoid _all_ discussions—open discussion moves us
    forward—but there is just
    [something generally unproductive about Internet comments](http://xkcd.com/386/).

  - There’s a lot of nuance in expressive thought that most cannot capture in a
    few paragraphs. Or, much worse, 140-character chunks, where you only have
    enough space to come off as a single-minded, self-serving jerk.

  - “Arguments aren’t about who wins. They’re about learning something.” But
    many don’t know that.

### Usability

- “Show the data.” — [Edward Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/)

  - Avoid implementing interfaces that hide their data, especially across
    different input devices and accessibility issues.

- Jakob Nielsen’s
  [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).

- Avoid interaction and modes.

  - [Most software is information software](http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/#most_software_is_information_software)
    and should minimize interaction and modes.

- User Testing, Field Studies, or, Get In Front Of The User ASAP

  - Design meetings, static mocks, paper prototypes, interactive prototypes,
    dogfooding are all _waste_ if your customer ends up hating the design or not
    using it.

  - Therefore it is prudent to introduce the user as early as possible.

  - Unfortunately it’s often
    [an uphill battle to introduce user testing to an organization](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-maturity-stages-1-4/),
    despite
    [usability’s known ROI](https://www.google.com/search?q=usability+roi). It’s
    hard to make people want something, when they think they have it covered.

  - So if you can’t get dedicated user testing, investigate how to deliver an
    interface cheaply and ASAP, knowing you might have to trash the work that
    went into it. Agile™ isn’t right for everyone. Facebook’s
    move-fast-and-break-things isn’t either. If you think Waterfall is dead, it
    took us to Mars. The point is, projects and companies are different. Spend
    the time to investigate what’s right for your team.
