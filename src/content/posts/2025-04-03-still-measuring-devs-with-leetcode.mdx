title: 'Still Measuring Devs With Leetcode?'

I'm disappointed to find tech interviews are still asking Leetcode questions.
Companies haven't listened to old advice on competitive hiring like DHH's
[Hiring programmers with a take-home test] or Matasano Security's [the Hiring
Post][The Hiring Post].

> Years from now, we'll look back at the 2015 developer interview as an

Even new companies today with the chance of a fresh, competitive approach are
still asking Leetcode questions, probably because the FAANG-equivalent companies
of decades ago were asking Leetcode questions, and a few FAANGs still are. A
100-employee startup primed me with an outline of their upcoming interview steps
with a link to a sample [leetcode.com][Leetcode] question to expect, boasting,
"Our interview process is similar to Meta's process."

For the last 10 years of my tech career, I didn't have to interview for jobs:
behold, the power of referral! Not interviewing meant no Leetcode questions. The
last time I had to answer a Leetcode question, the name Leetcode didn't exist,
although the style of questions was decades old.

I used to be pretty good at Leetcode questions. In my college computer science
degree, senior year, I went through 20 interview rounds with 12 different
companies. Only the final company accepted me. I didn't get better at
programming during that time, although that would have been a good use of my
time. Rather, in that time, I just got better at interviewing, and a lot of it
was practicing Leetcode-style questions, via [the first edition of Programming
Interviews Exposed][Programming Interviews Exposed]. Having little professional
experience, I accepted there was no other practice for companies to trust me.

Within a few years in the industry, it was my turn to be the interviewer, which
is when I got the perspective, the empathy for candidates. I wanted to shake
free of the cult of Leetcode hazing. It was an inaccurate and unfair way to
measure. I sought the advice of the posts at the beginning of this article. What
if we measured actual developer skill: can the candidate do the job well, rather
than can the candidate do Leetcode well? What if a candidate was a great fit for
the job, but the specialized simulacrum and pressure cooker of live-coding
Leetcode interviews excluded such a candidate?

Don't get me wrong, improving the situation was easier said than done. Hiring
developers is hard. My teams and I iterated for years on structuring our
interviews—a structured interview is fairer but sadly not the friendliest
candidate experience, to blankly read from a script—and developing relevant,
realistic, self-contained assessment projects for candidates. For take-home
tests, we didn't pay candidates for their time, which was tantamount to free
labor and exclusionary in its own regard. We also lost a great candidate who was
a prolific OSS contributor to our company's tech stack, because they
diplomatically pointed to their public contributions as evidence of their skill
and collaboration style, declined the take-home test as something they couldn't
afford (what were all their free labor OSS contributions for, after all), and
our team didn't have the capacity to develop and maintain a "fair" backup
measurement for the special case candidate. While our take-home test was a
promising hiring solution, we still could've done better.

I took a career break from tech the last couple years. When I started the tech
job hunt 12 months ago, wanting to try my old full stack web developer job in a
new domain, I no longer had the power of a referral. I program every day. I know
I can do the job. If an interviewer talks to me, I can demonstrate I know how to
program, I'm emotionally intelligent, and that their team would want to work
with someone friendly like me, right?

Much to my chagrin, almost every company I've interviewed with this year still
uses Leetcode-style interviews. If a company even gives the heads up of what to
expect in an interview, don't necessary believe, "Our live code assessment uses
real-world problems." In 9/10 of my interviews this year, the interview was
still Leetcode in a trenchcoat.

I was rusty at these live coding interviews, because in my 14 year career,
Leetcode and what it teaches _never came up_ on the job. Software development is
not typically done in a eye-movement surveilled, time-constrained screen-share
with 1-2 others silently breathing down your neck, letting you squirm, maybe a
modicum of hints that make sense to the interviewers because they've seen the
exact problem before. And there's no time left for me to ask questions. The
interview for mutual fit turns out not to be a 2-way street. It's dehumanizing
for the experienced dev.

When I'm rejected for a job, in my spirit of continual improvement, I ask for
feedback why, and companies are always cagey. To cover their ass. So I'm not
100% certain all the reasons I was rejected over the last 12 months. I might
have a worse personality than I think. Or maybe a member of the hiring panel was
underslept and cranky. Out of my control. All I know is, the interview process
ending always _correlated_ after I failed to finish a Leetcode step of the
interview, i.e. not finishing the coding puzzle prompt within 45 minutes.

Roy Lee, who developed [a tool to cheat on these sort of
interviews][Hard Fork: AI Action Plans], summarized what I was _supposed_ to do.

> You're given 45 minutes and the task here is to _have_ seen the problem
> before, solve the problem, and be able to regurgitate the memorized solution,
> without acting like you have seen the problem before.

In 2025's competitive tech hiring market, where laid-off tech workers outnumber
available positions, some candidates spend months grinding leetcode.com to reach
the top 1%, while others use cheating software like Roy Lee's. Meanwhile,
experienced developers who could do the actual job well but haven't memorized
these puzzles struggle to complete them under pressure. The unqualified
candidate aces the test. The qualified candidate fails to finish in time. As the
interviewer, which candidate would you advance?

Next time I'm on the job hunt, I hope to cross-reference my applications with
the [Hiring Without Whiteboards][Hiring Without Whiteboards] list. Although in
my 12 months of the recent job hunt, I made hundreds of applications and
received human responses from less than 10%. Given the odds, I felt I couldn't
afford to be choosy to use this list.

## Unused

While they assume just because a company is famous their interview process is
solid and adaptable to a SMB, I do appreciate they were honest about the
inclusion of Leetcode.

Cheating aside, AI-assisted coding tools are really great at Leetcode problems.
It's another hint, if it's easily solvable by computers, maybe it's not a great
test of an engineer?
