I'm disappointed to find tech interviews in 2025 are still asking LeetCode
questions. Companies haven't listened to old advice on competitive hiring like
DHH's [Hiring programmers with a take-home test] or Matasano Security's [the
Hiring Post][The Hiring Post].

Even new companies with the chance of a fresh, competitive approach are still
asking LeetCode questions, probably because the FAANG-equivalent companies of
decades ago were asking LeetCode questions. A few FAANGs still are. A
100-employee startup primed me with an outline of their upcoming interview steps
with a link to a sample [leetcode.com][LeetCode] question to expect, boasting,
"Our interview process is similar to Meta's process."

In the most recent 10 years of my tech career, I didn't have to interview for
jobs: behold, the power of referral! Not interviewing meant no LeetCode
questions. The last time I had to answer a LeetCode question, the name LeetCode
didn't exist, although the interview style was decades old.

I actually used to be pretty good at LeetCode questions. In my college computer
science degree, senior year, I went through 20 interview rounds with 12
different companies. Only the final company accepted me. I didn't get better at
programming during that time, though that would have been a good use of my time.
Rather, in that time, I just got better at interviewing. A lot of that was
practicing LeetCode-style questions, via [the first edition of Programming
Interviews Exposed][Programming Interviews Exposed]. Having little professional
experience, I accepted there was no other practice for me to gain companies'
trust.

Within a few years in the industry, when it was my turn to play interviewer, I
became empathetic to candidates. LeetCode hazing was an inaccurate and unfair
way to measure. What was it predicting? What hostility was it engendering? I
wanted to shake free of the cult. What if we measured actual developer skill:
can the candidate do the job well, rather than can the candidate do LeetCode
well? What if a candidate was a great fit for the job, but the specialized
simulacrum and pressure cooker of live-coding LeetCode interviews excluded such
a candidate? I sought the advice of the posts at the beginning of this article.

Improving the situation was and is easier said than done. Hiring developers is
hard. My teams iterated for years to 1) structure our interviews—a structured
interview is fairer but sadly not the friendliest candidate experience, for the
interviewer to read from a script _at_ the candidate—and 2) develop relevant,
realistic, self-contained assessment projects. For take-home assessments, we
didn't pay candidates for their time, which was tantamount to free labor and
exclusionary in its own regard. We also lost a great candidate who was a
prolific OSS contributor to our company's tech stack. They diplomatically
pointed to their public contributions as evidence of their skill and
collaboration style, and declined the take-home as something they couldn't
afford. What were all their free labor OSS contributions for, after all? Our
team didn't have the capacity to develop and maintain a "fair" backup
measurement for the special case. While our take-home assessment was a promising
hiring solution, we still could've done better.[^1]

I took a career break from tech the last couple years. When I started the tech
job hunt 12 months ago, wanting to try my old full stack web developer job in a
new domain, I no longer had the power of a referral. I program every day. I know
I can do the job. If an interviewer talks to me, I can demonstrate I know how to
program, I'm emotionally intelligent, and that their team would want to work
with someone friendly like me. Right?

Much to my chagrin, I didn't make it far in the interview process, because
almost every company I've interviewed with this year still uses LeetCode-style
interviews. If a company even gives the heads up of what to expect in an
interview, don't necessary believe, "Our live code assessment uses real-world
problems." In 9/10 of my interviews this year, the interview was still LeetCode
in a trenchcoat.

I was rusty at these live coding interviews, because in my 14 year career,
LeetCode and what it teaches _never came up_ on the job. Software development is
not typically done in a eye-movement surveilled, time-constrained screen-share
with 1-2 others silently breathing down your neck, letting you squirm. Maybe the
interviewers offer a modicum of hints that make sense to them, as they've seen
the exact problem several times. Then there's no time left for me to ask them
questions about the job. The interview for mutual fit turns out not to be a
2-way street. It's dehumanizing for the experienced dev.

When I'm rejected after an interview, in my spirit of continual improvement, I
ask for feedback why. 9/10 companies are cagey, to cover their ass. So I'm not
fully certain all the reasons I was rejected over the last 12 months. I might
have a worse personality than I think. Maybe a member of the hiring panel was
underslept and cranky. All I know is, the interview process ending _correlated_
after I failed to finish a LeetCode step of the interview, i.e. not finishing
the coding puzzle prompt within 45 minutes.

Roy Lee, developer of [a tool to cheat on these sort of
interviews][Hard Fork: AI Action Plans], summarized what I was _supposed_ to do.

> You're given 45 minutes and the task here is to _have_ seen the problem
> before, solve the problem, and be able to regurgitate the memorized solution,
> without acting like you have seen the problem before.

In 2025's competitive tech hiring market, where laid-off tech workers outnumber
available positions, some candidates spend months grinding leetcode.com to reach
the top 1%, so they may be lucky enough to have already seen the 1 interview
puzzle close to the 1,000 they could be given. Other candidates use cheating
software like Lee's. Meanwhile, experienced developers who could do the actual
job well but haven't memorized these puzzles struggle to complete them under
pressure. The unqualified candidate aces the test. The qualified candidate fails
to finish in time, though they might explain what they _would_ do next, given
more time. For your overloaded hiring pipeline, which candidate would you
advance? The test ace or the struggling explainer?

Lee answered whether he had ethical concerns about his product.

> LeetCode interviews are about as correlated \[to the job] as, "How many

Ethics aside, AI-assisted coding tools are great at solving LeetCode problems.
They have memorized 1,000s of such puzzles. If something is easily solvable by
computers, maybe that's another hint it's not a great test of a software
developer?

I haven't subscribed to Lee's product. All I know is, I like using AI-assisted
coding in my normal job. It would be realistic to have normal tools available in
an assessment.

While the debate of allowed tools in an assessment rages on, to skip the debate
next time I'm on the job hunt, I hope to cross-reference my applications with
the [Hiring Without Whiteboards] list. Companies on the list don't make
qualified devs jump through hoops with puzzles like LeetCode. The only reason I
didn't use the list is the 2025 tech hiring market is very difficult.[^2] I felt
beggars couldn't be choosers. So I unfortunately encountered a lot of companies
that use LeetCode interviews.

I hope more companies think harder who they're looking for. They're missing out
on qualified devs by following what's trendy. They're dehumanzing candidates. I
hope to see the companies one day make the Hiring Without Whiteboards list.

    The confluence of difficulties in the tech hiring market in 2015 vs. 2025:
    the magic-promising whisper of "AI" in leadership's ears, venture capital
    interest rates, and overhiring from the early COVID-19 pandemic, resulting
    in big tech layoffs and an overflowing candidate pool. In 12 months, I
    applied to 200+ companies. Less than 10% gave a human response. 50% sent an
    automated rejection from a "no-reply" email address, within 1-3 months. The
    rest never tell you the result of your application either way.
