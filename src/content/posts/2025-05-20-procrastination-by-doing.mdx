I suffer from a particular form of procrastination: procrastination by doing.
Let me illustrate what it is. Then, I have some tips to fight it.

Let's say I have a big-picture software architecture task my boss assigned me.
My problem is not that I instead watch Netflix, unable to get off the couch. I
_will_ do productive work. It just won't be the assigned task. It is precisely
when facing an important task that I will draw from the following types of other
tasks.

1. Run and fold laundry.
2. Pop over to the store for that one low pantry item.
3. Debug why Vim isn't showing autocomplete suggestions in _one_ file.

None of these are the assigned task.

Oh gee, it's the end of the work day! Guess I'll take another stab at the big
task tomorrow.

And so it goes. Sometimes for days.

The parable of the jar of rocks, pebbles, and sand comes to mind. People
interpret it a lot of ways and it is problematic in a lot of ways.[^1] Here's my
takeaway of the parable.

</figure>

- The jar represents the bounds of what you can accomplish in a day. You have
  finite attention, time, and energy.
- Rocks represent big-picture tasks that will accomplish something
  extraordinary. You might not immediately know how to do them. It will take
  some exploration.
- Pebbles could be a bugfix ticket, even a critical bug, but it won't win your
  team any awards. ("Why did you commit the bug in the first place?")
- Sand is the bureaucracy that carries zero glory, and won't set you or your
  team apart. At work, this includes checking email, answering email, and
  proofreading others' work. The tasks do need to get done, but they are a lower
  value distraction from your limited attention. Especially if you make
  (self-inflict) a reputation of being good at sand tasks.

What order do you insert the rocks, pebbles, and sand into the jar, to be most
optimal with the bounds of the jar? If you buy into the parable's model, the
answer is: rocks first, then pebbles, then sand. If you insert the sand first,
you leave no room for the rest.

Opening your email client for what we optimistically estimate as a 1 minute
check or a 5 minute reply instead wastes 15-45 minutes of your day. Checking
email multiple times compounds the waste. If you fill your day with activities
like this, you won't leave room for the bigger tasks. You procrastinated on the
big-picture, valuable task not by doing nothing, but by consuming your attention
with a different, lesser task.

The dopamine hit of smaller sand tasks is rewarding, comforting, and addictive
compared to the difficult, mysterious big rock task. Small task dopamine is a
slot machine though. Slot machines don't always pay out. Especially in your
long-term satisfaction. The days upon days of focusing on sand and never the
high-visibility rocks you're supposed to could get you fired. The slot machine
could eventually bankrupt you. This is similar to how a real slot machine
exploits gamblers.

I have a few tips to reframe and fight the todo list procrastination by doing,
to properly order the jar of rocks, pebbles, and sand.

1. Do the hardest thing first.
2. Start before you're ready.
3. Stop before you're done.

## Do the hardest thing first

When you start work for the day and are still waking up, slurping your coffee,
you might be tempted to catch up on email, what happened since you signed off
yesterday.

Careful. Those notifications are _sand_. Addressed first, they will fill your
jar.

Be deliberate when you open your email client. I recommend whittling down the
checks to around once per day, and not first thing. Be explicit with your team
and boss about email reading and about responsiveness expectations. Be explicit
that there is a tradeoff if email replies are expected first thing in your
morning: it is energy that could be directed to rocks. Does the boss not want
rocks getting tackled consistently?

Now that you've punted the sand on your todo list, pay attention to your mind
drifting away from rocks and instead toward pebbles. "I'm still waking up, just
a quick task to warm up to the day." No, that's the dopamine slot machine
calling again. Go for the rocks.

When your energy dips later in the day, when you need to stop your big rock
task, _then_ you can address sand, like opening your email client.

I think we've come to believe the warm up task is sensible, because we compare
our brains warming up to knowledge work the way an athlete warms up their body
before a competition. The problem is warming up knowledge work with other
knowledge work. A better way to wake up your brain prior to the rock would be
with non-work exercise, like going for a walk. Exercise stretches the brain's
capacity for the next part of your day, rather than consuming its finite
attention.

But don't let the non-work exercise become the sand of non-work chores.

## Start before you're ready

For a mysterious, big rock task that's full of unknowns, the payoff is not
obvious to the brain. The brain will face boredom or existential crisis. Even if
you resist the knowledge work pebbles and sand, you might still be tempted to:

1. Locate your favorite pen (surely then the words will flow).
2. Put on the perfect productivity playlist (surely it'll get you in the mood).
3. Boil water for the next cuppa.
4. All while starting the laundry machine (because parallel productivity
   efficiency).

**Don't.** You don't need any of the pen, music, boiled water, or laundry to
tackle the rock. You can do it without them. Automatic as some of them seem,
coordinating them will drain your limited attention and time. Skip them for now.
Rather, start your task now.

### System 1 vs. System 2 Thinking

Be aware of your body's 2 attention and organization systems. In _[Thinking,
Fast and Slow]_, Daniel Kahneman introduces System 1 as intuitive, quick,
unconscious thinking, and System 2 as slower, effortful, logical thinking. I
extend these concepts from thinking to getting your _whole body_ into action. I
think we've all experienced the disconnect between the two systems.

System 1, in addition to thinking, is the tendency for the body to keep doing
the same action it's doing, resisting change. Examples:

- I'm comfy, I don't want to get out of bed.
- I'm having fun with friends at the party, I don't want to leave.
- I already can't focus at work, so what's one more social media refresh.

System 2 plans ahead:

- I'm going to start going to the gym.
- I _have_ to get started on my school essay that's due soon. I'm going to block
  off all Saturday morning to do it. _Then_ I can go party.

System 2 may plan all that out. Noble. When Saturday morning comes, guess which
system is in charge? Despite all your planning, System 1 wants you to continue
what you're doing. That means staying comfy in bed. It is high effort to break
free.

Being mindful of these systems, you can hack them.

</aside>

So you notice and resist the around-the-house chores to supposedly put you in
the perfect headspace to actually work on your big task. You break free from the
pursuit of being perfectly ready.

If you then chip away at your big task for 20 minutes, your body will likely
want to continue. System 1 takes over, to your benefit.

This is the same strategy as ["don't break the
chain."][How to Stop Procrastinating on Your Goals by Using the “Seinfeld Strategy”]
I've also heard this called "systems over goals" or "practice over product."
Overly focusing on the end result can overwhelm you with how far away it is. The
overwhelm can divert you to check your email, a sand task you have more
confidence in. The more sustainable, less daunting strategy is to start the big
rock task, and do a little bit consistently.

The big rock task will have meaningful progress for the day. Even if you don't
finish the task, you'll end the day a lot more satisfied, with something to
show, versus if you hadn't touched the task at all.

The flow of progress can be a healthy addiction. To be sustainable, however, you
should even embrace _not_ finishing the task.

## Stop before you're done

"What, now I'm flying on this task, and you want me to stop?" Yes, there is a
counterbalance.

In theory, it's nice to end every day with todo list zero. Perhaps some of us
aspire to this from lessons in childhood. Perhaps school admonished us for a
half-thought out essay or an incomplete exam. We also hear, for example, it's
nice to end the day with your loved ones at peace, "Never go to bed angry."
Imagine, each day of your life could be a neatly wrapped up movie plot.

Resist the urge to fulfill this completionism. Get comfortable leaving things
partway done.

Because your life isn't just your big rock task, it isn't a neatly wrapped up
movie, it's also your life. There must be more to your identity than work. If
you always continue on a task until it is done or you have no energy left, you
will burn out.

At the very least, you need to break to eat and sleep. You contain the
multitudes of many interests, activities, and social bonds. You respect those
other facets of your life and leave energy for them by not letting your big rock
tasks completely overwrite your life. Plan the break for lunch. Plan the dinner
reservation with a friend to bookend your workday. Schedule the board game
night, group hike, or the gym class. Play and rest are essential.

Besides, you can't tackle big rock mysterious tasks with an underslept mind and
body. Given a break, your subconscious mind digests the task. The following day,
it may have a better solution for you, at the ready.

After your workday, don't return to the work. You won't be putting in high
quality work. You'll get diminishing returns. You'll hurt your sleep. The work
will be there waiting for you the next workday.

Plan to stop the work before it's done sometimes, so the work doesn't overwrite
everything else in your day or life. To be sustainable and not burn out. Life is
a marathon, not a sprint.[^2]

## No cure-all

I said at the beginning, "I suffer" from procrastination by doing, present
tense. While I'm by no means cured of procrastination, remembering and
practicing the 3 tips in this post help me. Even if they make life just 1%
better for a single day's tasks. 1% sounds small, but the flow of progress and
the morale boosts compound over time.

I hope these tips help you too. If you're like me, you'll still procrastinate by
doing sometimes. But with awareness and practice, you can accomplish _truly_
rewarding tasks. Not just quick dopamine hits. You can accomplish goals with
less pain, and maintain a healthier balance between work, rest, and the other
important parts of your life.

## Footnotes

[^1]:
    Oliver Burkeman's _[Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for
    Mortals][Four Thousand Weeks]_ has a good critique of the parable. For
    example, [there are many rocks that never make it near the
    jar][Choosing Rocks].

    The book is also a good introduction to mindfulness about big, mysterious
    tasks forcing you to reckon with your limited time on earth. The existential
    dread is easier to bury with distractions like email or social media.

[^2]:
    I'm hesitant about this analogy, because a marathon is brutal. It is
    dramatic to compare life or work to an athletic challenge only a small
    percentage of humans will ever do.
