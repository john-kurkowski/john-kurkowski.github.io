I suffer from a particular form of procrastination: procrastination by doing. I
have some tips to fight it. First, let me illustrate procrastination by doing.

Let's say I have a big-picture software architecture task my boss assigned me.
My problem is not that I instead watch Netflix, unable to get off the couch. I
_will_ do productive work. It just won't be the assigned task. It is precisely
when facing an important task that I will draw from the following types of other
tasks.

1. Run and fold laundry.
2. Pop over to the store for that one low pantry item.
3. Debug why Vim isn't showing autocomplete suggestions in _one_ file.

None of these are the assigned task.

Oh gee, it's the end of the work day! Guess I'll take another stab at the big
task tomorrow.

And so it goes for days.

The parable of the jar of rocks, pebbles, and sand comes to mind. People
interpret it a lot of ways and it is problematic in a lot of ways.[^1]

> All models are wrong, but some are useful.

Here's my takeaway of the parable.

- The jar represents the bounds of what you can accomplish in a day, i.e. finite
  attention, time, and energy.
- Rocks represent big-picture tasks that will accomplish something
  extraordinary. You might not immediately know how to do them. It will take
  some exploration.
- Pebbles could be a bugfix ticket, even a critical bug, but it won't win your
  team any awards. ("Why did you commit the bug in the first place?")
- Sand is the bureaucracy that carries zero glory and won't set you or your team
  apart. At work, this includes checking email, answering email, and
  proofreading others' work. The tasks do need to get done, but they are a lower
  value distraction from your limited attention. Especially if you make
  (self-inflict) a reputation of being good at such tasks.

What order do you insert the rocks, pebbles, and sand into the jar, to be most
optimal with the bounds of the jar? The common answer is rocks first, then
pebbles, then sand. If you insert the sand first, you leave no room for the
rest.

Opening your email client for what we optimistically estimate as a 1 minute
check or a 5 minute reply instead wastes 15-45 minutes. Checking email multiple
times a day compounds the waste. If you fill your day with activities like this,
you won't leave room for the bigger tasks. You're filling your jar with sand
before you add the rocks and pebbles. You were supported to fill the jar in the
opposite order. You procrastinated on the big-picture, valuable task, not by
doing nothing, but by doing a different, lesser task.

The dopamine hit of smaller sand tasks is rewarding and more addictive than the
difficult, mysterious big rock task. Small task dopamine is a slot machine
though. Slot machines don't always pay out. Especially in your long-term
satisfaction. The days of focusing on sand and never the high-visibility rocks
you're supposed to? That could get you fired. What if the slot machine bankrupts
you? It's similar to how a real slot machine exploits gamblers.

I have a few tips to reframe the todo list procrastination by doing, to properly
order the jar of rocks, pebbles, and sand.

1. Do the hardest thing first.
2. Start before you're ready.
3. Stop before you're done.

## Do the hardest thing first

When you start work for the day and are still waking up, slurping your coffee,
you might be tempted to catch up on email, what happened since you signed off
yesterday. Be careful, those notifications are _sand_. Addressed first, they
will fill your jar.

Be deliberate when you open your email client. I recommend whittling down the
checks to around once per day. Be explicit with your team and boss about email
reading, and responsiveness expectations. Be explicit that there is a tradeoff
if email replies are expected first thing in your morning: it is energy that
could be directed to rocks. Does the boss not want rocks getting tackled
consistently?

Now that you've punted the sand on your todo list, pay attention to your mind
drifting away from rocks and instead toward pebbles. "I'm still waking up, just
a quick task to warm up to the day." No, that's the dopamine slot machine
calling again. Go for the rocks.

When your energy dips later in the day, and you need to stop your big rock task,
_then_ you can address sand, like opening your email client.

I think we've come to believe the warm up task is sensible, because we compare
our brains warming up to knowledge work the way an athlete warms up their body
before a competition. The problem is warming up knowledge work with other
knowledge work. A better way to wake up your brain prior to the rock would be
with exercise, like a walk. That stretches the brain's capacity for the next
part of your day, rather than consuming its finite attention.

But don't let the non-work exercise bleed into the sand of non-work chores.

## Start before you're ready

For a mysterious, big rock task that's full of unknowns, the payoff is not
obvious to the brain. The brain will face boredom or existential crisis. Even if
you resist the knowledge work pebbles and sand, you might still be tempted to
locate your favorite pen, put on just the perfect mood productivity playlist, or
boil water for the next cuppa. All while starting the laundry machine, because
that chore parallelizes.

You don't need any of the pen, music, boiled water, or laundry to tackle the
rock. You can do it without them. Skip them for now.

If you chip away at your big task for 20 minutes, your body will likely want to
continue. This is the same strategy as [_don't break the chain_], and [_systems
over goals_]. The big rock task will have meaningful progress for the day. Even
if you don't finish the task, you'll end the day a lot more satisfied, with
something to show, versus if you hadn't touched the task at all.

To be sustainable, however, you should even embrace _not_ finishing the task.

## Stop before you're done

"What, now I'm flying on this task, and you want me to stop?" Yes, there is a
counterbalance.

In theory, it's nice to end every day with todo list zero. Perhaps some of us
aspire to this from lessons in childhood. Perhaps school admonished us for a
half-thought out essay or an incomplete exam. We also hear, for example, it's
nice to end the day with your loved ones at peace, "Never go to bed angry."
Imagine, each day of your life could be a neatly wrapped up movie plot.

Resist the urge to fulfill this completionism. Get comfortable leaving things
partway done.

Because your life isn't just your big rock task, it isn't a neatly wrapped up
movie, it's also your life. There must be more to your identity than work. If
you continue on a task until it is done or you have no energy left to work on
the task, you will burn out. At the very least, you need to break to eat and
sleep. You contain the multitudes of many interests, activities, and social
bonds. You respect those other facets of your life and leave energy for them by
not letting your big rock tasks completely overwrite your life. Plan the break
for lunch. Plan the dinner reservation with a friend. Schedule the board game
night, group hike, or the gym class. Play and rest are essential.

Besides, you can't tackle big rock mysterious tasks with an underslept mind and
body. Given a break, your subconscious mind digests the task. The following day,
it may have a better solution for you, at the ready.

After your workday, don't return to the work. You won't be putting in high
quality work, you'll get diminishing returns, and you'll hurt your sleep. The
work will be there waiting for you the next workday.

Plan to stop the work before it's done sometimes. So the work doesn't overwrite
everything else in your day or life. To be sustainable and not burn out. Life is
a marathon, not a sprint.[^2]

## No cure-all

I said at the beginning, "I suffer" from procrastination by doing, present
tense. While I'm by no means cured of procrastination, remembering and
practicing the 3 tips in this post help me. Even if they make life just 1%
better at a time. 1% sounds small, but the improvements compound.

I hope these tips help you too. If you're like me, you'll still procrastinate by
doing sometimes. But with awareness and practice, you can accomplish _truly_
rewarding tasks. Not just quick dopamine hits. You can accomplish goals with
less pain, and maintain a healthier balance between work, rest, and the other
important parts of your life.

## Footnotes

[^1]:
    Oliver Burkeman's
    [Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54785515-four-thousand-weeks)
    has a good critique of the parable. For example,
    [there are many rocks that never make it near the jar](https://www.benwhite.com/misc/choosing-rocks/).
    The book is also a good introduction to mindfulness about big, mysterious
    tasks forcing you to reckon with your limited time on earth. The existential
    dread is easier to bury with distractions like email or social media.

[^2]:
    I'm hesitant about this analogy, because a marathon is brutal. It is
    dramatic to compare life or work to an athletic challenge only a small
    percentage of humans will ever do.

    A sprint is brutal in a different way, here meant to contrast activities
    sustainable over a long time span vs. activities only sustainable over a
    short time span. It is funny that Agile names its timed chunks of work after
    an unsustainable activity.
