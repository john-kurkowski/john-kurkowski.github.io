  <h2>About Me</h2>

    <strong>usability</strong> and data transparency, making the audience more
    informed, productive, engaged, &amp; entertained.

  <h2>Colophon</h2>

  <aside>
    <p>
      I'm not interested in getting on a high horse about the technologies I use;
      there's enough <a href="http://prog21.dadgum.com/56.html">coding</a> <a href="http://prog21.dadgum.com/142.html">zeal</a> on the Interwebs.
      For my blog's primary audience, an excruciating list of web tech is blas√©.
      But I will include this section for the sake of the curious,
      perhaps for the newcomer, how I cobbled together this site.
      While I've put my 10,000 hours into programming, <a href="http://vimeo.com/71278954">
      I take a look back bewildered</a>: programming is still something new
      every day, which is both thrilling and frustrating, "Why isn't this easier?"
      For the uninitiated, an unintuitive jigsaw of lines of <em>text</em> jammed
      together. So how does anyone ever get to the point of realizing their own
      website? I don't have a great answer. A colophon is the least I can do.
    </p>

    <p>
      And there's probably smarter ways to do it. The work I did for this site,
      does it offer building blocks for future sites? Is it
      underengineered? Over? Was I lazy? Or was I not lazy enough?

  <!-- Content -->

  <p>
    For a site this small and content unchanging, there is no CMS. No database.
    Nothing dynamic. The content is static, versioned in <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>,
    generated into a site by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.
    It is hosted by <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.
    The source code is available on <a href="http://github.com/john-kurkowski/john-kurkowski.github.io">GitHub</a> as well.
  </p>

  <!-- Style -->

  <p>
    This site's template is a modification of Jekyll's stock <a href="todo">___</a>.
    The preferred font is the humanist sans-serif <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optima">Optima</a>,
    widely installed on Mac OS X. On Windows, this site will degrade to either
    humanist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segoe">Segoe</a> or Helvetica.
    <a href="http://pygments.org/">Pygments</a> highlights code snippets in a
    <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">Solarized</a> color scheme.
  </p>

  <!-- Behavior -->

  <p>
    For some of the layouts, behaviors, and animations that are tricky in CSS,
    I use the JavaScript libraries <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>,
    for more maintainable JavaScript components &amp; organization, and
    <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, for lower-level DOM manipulation.
